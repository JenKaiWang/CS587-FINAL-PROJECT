      "\n",
      "From the customer message, we can identify the following User Stories:\n",
      "1. **As a customer**, I want to input my budget for the insurance plan, so that I can see options within my financial range.\n",
      "2. **As a customer**, I want to specify the reason I need insurance, so that the app can recommend plans tailored to my situation.\n",
      "3. **As a customer**, I want to select my current status (e.g., student, adult), so that the recommendations can consider my life stage.\n",
      "4. **As a customer**, I want to receive recommendations for insurance based on my inputs, so that I can make an informed decision.\n",
